# Dijkstra, Prim, and DFS Algorithms Practice

## 📌 About the Project
This project implements three fundamental graph algorithms: **Dijkstra's Shortest Path**, **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree**, and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. The program demonstrates how these algorithms work on adjacency matrices.

## 🚀 Features
✅ **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph

✅ **Prim's Algorithm** for constructing a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)

✅ **Depth-First Search (DFS)** for graph traversal

✅ **Graph representation using adjacency matrices**

✅ **Console-based execution with predefined graph structures**

## ⚡ Usage
The project runs automatically and executes the following functions:

1️⃣ **Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm**

2️⃣ **Prim's Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm**

3️⃣ **Depth-First Search (DFS) Algorithm**

## 🛠 Installation and Execution

1️⃣ **Clone the project:**
```sh
 git clone https://github.com/kullanici/graph-algorithms.git
```

2️⃣ **Compile and run:**
```sh
